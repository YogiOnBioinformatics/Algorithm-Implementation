# Network Analysis Using Graph Theory   

The goal of this project was to gain a better understanding of graphs and graph algorithms through practical implementation. The implementation in this case used multiple different types of graph data structures to help find bottlenecks, smallest latency trees, etc. Details about the software as well as the source code to use can be found in the `doc/` and `src/` folders, respectively.
