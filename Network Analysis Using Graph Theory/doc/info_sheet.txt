Does your program run without error?: Everything except checking for copper connection

If not, what is/are the error(s) and which parts of your program run
correctly?:
It seems to always return "not copper connected". Was not able to debug what exactly was wrong. 






Additional comments to the grader:
Hopefully, for the amount of work I put in to the copper connection, I can still get adequate points.
