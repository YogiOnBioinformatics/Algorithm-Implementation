# Essays on Algorithm Implementation and Abstraction 

This folder contains 3 different essays which were written during the Algorithm Implementation (CS1501) course at the University of Pittsburgh. Details about the essays are provided below: 

**LSD Radix Sort**

This essay explains the `LSD Radix` sort algorithm as well as elucidates how it can be used for an imaginary spreadsheet to be sorted. The imaginary spreadsheet contains personally identifiable information such as work ID's or even social security numbers in a large quanitity. The essay explains the advantages of `LSD Radix` sort for such an application while viewing other less beneficial sorting methods. 

**Describing MyLZW Optimizations** 

This essay goes into depth about the `LZW` compression algorithm while running through the code of an implementation of this algorithm known as `MyLZW.java`. The paper looks at different "modes" of `LZW` and how they have been implemented/the benefits the modes give. 

**Rabin-Karp** 

This paper looks at the benefits and history of the `Rabin-Karp` string pattern matching algorithm. It compares and contrasts it with other well known string pattern matching algorithms looking specifically at memory overhead and runtime complexity.
