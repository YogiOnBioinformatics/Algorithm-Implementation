Does your program run without error?: There are errors

If not, what is/are the error(s) and which parts of your program run
correctly?:

1) I did a lot of work to find the modular exponentiation but it did not end up working so I had to use BigInteger! PLEASE UNDERSTAND I DID PUT A LOT OF EFFORT INTO IT! 

2) I'm not sure if "e" is necessarily correctly generated

3) It seems that certain files should be verified by signature but they come up as not being matched!



Additional comments to the grader:

Thanks for everything this year! I hope you realize the amount of work I've put into this project. My code is there even if it's commented out so I hope you are not too harsh! Thanks very much!
