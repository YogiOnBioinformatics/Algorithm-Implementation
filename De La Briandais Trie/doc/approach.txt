Approach

My approach to implementing the Symbol Table involved using Java.util.HashMap. 
I decided to use this because of how quick this data structure is. 
In terms of asymptotic run-time statistics, the methods get() and put() which I used frequently ran in O(1). 
Due to the speed of inputting and outputting data from this structure, I felt it to be the best for my project.
