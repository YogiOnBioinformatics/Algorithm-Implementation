# LZW Implementation Instructions    

If you are interested in using this software, follow the execution rules that are listed in the `/src/README.md` file which explain how to compress and expand files. This is a **lossless** compression algorithm. Feel free to test this. The other file in this folder, `results.txt`, contains a table of file size values for compressed and non-compressed data. The software is based on two main methods, `compress()` and `expand()`.
